# frequent-pattern-mining
In this project, we want to extract frequent patterns from Divar and Digikala dataset.
Various statistical algorithms have been implemented to extract frequent patterns and associative rules, in this project, we used the Apriori algorithm to extract frequent patterns.

datasets can be downloaded from the link below :

Our main goal is to extract the following patterns from Divar and Digikala datasets:

1- Extracting the patterns of placing product sales posts in different cities in the Divar dataset

2- Extraction of sales patterns of different products in the Digikala dataset (Patterns between city name and product ID - Patterns between city name and product order year)

3- Extracting frequent patterns between the day of publication of the post and the platform used in the Divar dataset

4- Extracting frequent patterns for the product and platform used in the Divar dataset
